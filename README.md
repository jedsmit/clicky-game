# GoatyGoatyGoatClick

GoatyGoatyGoatClick is a simple, one page react app. It is a memory game that asks the user to click twelve different goat images without clicky the same one twice. After the user clicks a goat, one point is added to the score and the images shuffle randomly. If the user clicks the same image twice, the game ends and the score is reset to zero. If the user plays again after losing, the app keeps track of the top score achieved by the user. This resets everytime the app is relaunched.
